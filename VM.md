## [Setting Up A Virtual Machine](http://hackeryou.github.io/vagrant_vm/)

We are developing on a Virtual Machine (VM). The VM is running linux with Ruby 2.0, Rails 4.0, git, mysql, etc. 

1. Open a command line window, the default location should be the home directory. Change to the 'hacker_you' folder.
``` $ cd hacker_you ```
Inside the hacker_you folder start the VM with:
``` $ vagrant up ```
2. Mac users - enter the VM with:
``` $ vagrant ssh ```
