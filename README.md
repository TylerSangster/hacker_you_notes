# HackerYou Summer Academy Notes

The objective of this repository is twofold: to *collaboratively create a good set of notes for the whole class* and *to practice working on a real git repository*.

## Contributing
1. Fork it on github.com
2. Clone your fork (`git clone git@github.com:<username>/hacker_you_notes.git`)
3. Add the original repo as upstream (`git remote add upstream https://github.com/aomra015/hacker_you_notes.git`)
4. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`). This isolates your changes into their own branch, making contributions easier to merge.
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create new Pull Request on github.com
8. Keep your fork up to date with `git pull upstream master`
